## House Scraper

This is a Python program that scrapes house listings from a real estate website and saves the data to a CSV file. The program uses the `tkinter` library for a simple graphical user interface.

### Installation

To use this program, you will need Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `pandas`
- `tkinter`

To install the required libraries, run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

To run the program, execute the `main.py` file in your terminal. The program will open a GUI window where you can input the number of pages to scrape, the URL of the website, and the name of the output CSV file. Click the "Enter" button to start the scraping process.

The program will display a message box to let you know that it is running. Once the process is complete, the program will save the data to a CSV file in the same directory as the `main.py` file.
